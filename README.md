<h3 align="center"> Graduated MSc student from HWU in robotics and SLAM</h3>

# Domains
I am a software engineer specialized in mobile robitics, vision and AI.

My interest areas go for SLAM, navigation and robots collaboration. I am also interested in AI applied to robotics, especially on swarm computing. <!-- I would like to study the mix of AI and robotics like swarm computing. -->

# What I did

I developped a navigation system for a fleet of robots. Each robot are sharing the same map and navigate together on given points.

I did my Master's thesis in 2022 on Spot. My goal was to enhance a navigation software using ROS on spot to make the robot not only move in a room, but to make it navigates on multiple floors. Spot can navigate on a graph. Spot can create new waypoints, load a new set of wayopints and changing the map while navigating. It can also recognise stairs. 

I worked as a robotics engineer, where I enhanced the robots' navigation and local planner systems, enabling them to re-localize independently without external assistance. Additionally, I worked on the robots' data recorder and conducted data analysis on the robots.
