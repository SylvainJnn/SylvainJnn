# What I did

I did my master thesis in 2022 on Spot. My goal was to enhance a navigation software using ROS on spot to make the robot not only move in a room, but to make it navigates on multiple floors. Spot can navigate on a graph put a on map. Spot can create new waypoints, load a new set of wayopints and changing the map while navigating. It can also recognise stairs. 

As job, I am now working on the navigation system for a terrastrial robots.
